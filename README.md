### Dataset

We'll be exploring the [Google Merchandise Store](https://www.googlemerchandisestore.com/) dataset, containing data on website users from the US from October 1, 2016, to December 31, 2016. This dataset is sourced from the Google Merchandise Store, a real e-commerce platform offering Google-branded merchandise, including apparel, lifestyle products, and stationery from Google and its brands. While some sensitive fields have been obfuscated for privacy reasons, this dataset provides a unique opportunity to analyze actual customer behavior and trends in an e-commerce setting.

*Disclaimer: for this analysis, certain fields within the dataset have been aggregated. The original dataset is available as a public dataset in Google BigQuery.*

### Situation
The Google Marketing Team in the US was facing challenges in several key areas of their online business. Despite having a robust platform and a diverse range of products, the company was not fully leveraging its potential. With various strategies and channels in play, it was quite challenging to accurately assess the impact of different marketing initiatives and prove their effectiveness to stakeholders.

To address these challenges, the Google Marketing Team focused on gaining insights into several key areas:

- How do users interact with our e-commerce platform? Are there specific user behaviors or patterns that can inform our marketing strategies?
- How effective are our promotional campaigns and discount strategies in driving sales? Do these initiatives lead to long-term customer retention or only short-term gains?
- How does the user experience on our website and mobile app impact sales and customer engagement? Are there areas in need of improvement?
- Which geographical markets or customer segments are most profitable? Are there emerging markets or segments that we should focus on?
- How effective are our current strategies in acquiring new customers and retaining existing ones?
- Which traffic channels are yielding the highest conversion rates? What are the underlying reasons for variations in conversion rates across different channels?

### Task
As marketing analyst my task involved conducting a detailed analysis of the e-commerce platform's performance.
My main objective was to develop actionable strategies that would enhance overall performance. This included focusing on key areas such as customer acquisition, retention, monetization, and more efficient use of marketing channels.
The ultimate aim was to significantly boost overall revenue.

### Action
As marketing analyst I used SQL to create a database and merge multiple datasets into a unified one for in-depth analysis, followed by thorough data preprocessing, including cleansing to ensure accuracy and reliability.
I then conducted advanced analyses using advanced string, date and window functions to gain deeper insights into the website's performance, focusing on user interactions and the effectiveness of the e-commerce strategies.
Additionally, I analyzed various web traffic sources to identify the most effective channels for driving sales and conversions, turning data into actionable business intelligence.

### Set Up & Datasets
In MySQL Workbench, I have created a new database called ``` gms_project ```. This database will be used to store tables and data as part of our project.
